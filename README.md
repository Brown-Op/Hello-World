# Hello-World
The Beginning of something great!


About Me:
  My name is Zac I'm 22 years old and have a passion with technology as it fascinates me. I always want to learn more wether it's with computers, cars, simple hardware or software but knowledge is important to me. I wish i would've started this journey earlier! I now work in a Plant with a wild work schedule and want to escape it to pursue a job more fitting to my passions and dream.
